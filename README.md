# LuaPbIntf
Binding Protobuf to Lua53 with lua-intf

NOT READY!

LuaPbIntf is inspired by [luapb](https://github.com/zhanjunxiong/luapb),
  but has been rewritten to take advantage of
  [lua-intf](https://github.com/SteveKChiu/lua-intf),
  which makes the binding easier to use and easier to understand.

LuaPbIntf will dynamic load Protocol Buffer message definition files .proto
  without code generation.
